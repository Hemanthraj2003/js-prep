# What is JavaScript?

- JavaScript is a `programming language` commonly used in web development to create dynamic web content.

- It is a versatile language that can be used for both `client-side` and `server-side` development.

## HISTORY

- JavaScript was created in `1995` by `Brendan Eich` while working at `Netscape`.

- It is maintained by the `ECMA International` organization, which standardizes the language through the `ECMAScript` specification.

## HOW JS WORKS

- JavaScript code is executed by a `JavaScript engine`, which is built into web browsers and other environments.

  - chrome - `V8 engine`

  - firefox - `SpiderMonkey engine`

- JS can run outside the browser using environments like `Node.js` which uses the `V8 engine`, and `Deno` which uses the `V8 engine`.

- In order to run JavaScript code in a web browser, it is typically embedded in an HTML document using the `<script>` tag.

- we can use JS in two ways:

  - **Inline JavaScript**: Writing JavaScript code directly within the HTML document using the `<script>` tag.

  - **External JavaScript**: Linking to an external JavaScript file using the `src` attribute of the `<script>` tag.

## WHAT TYPE OF LANGUAGE IS JS?

- we can say that JavaScript is a `high-level`, `interpreted`, `dynamic`, and `multi-paradigm` programming language.

- **High-level**`: JavaScript abstracts away most of the complex details of the computer's hardware, allowing developers to write code in a more human-readable form.

- **Interpreted**: JS is executed line by line by a JavaScript engine, rather than being compiled into machine code before execution.

- **Dynamic**: JS is a dynamically typed language, which means that variable types are determined at runtime rather than at compile time.

- **Multi-paradigm**: JS supports multiple programming paradigms, including `object-oriented`, `functional`, and `imperative` programming.
